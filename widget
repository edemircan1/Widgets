NO : the submitted parametes card is only being shown when I'm drawing SECOND bounding box. and when it's on DRAWING... Stage. as soon as i complete drawing it's gone. the logic should be : once user submits and finishes the first optimization, we want to show' submitted parameters' card staticly. and when user clicks on draw new, it'll bring back the options when submitting the opto request, but once the second one is completed, then when user switching between results, it should also affect this static card.
