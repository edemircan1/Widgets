1)drawing new optimization, it's running fine, but in return, it still doesn't show the selected FREQUENCY. it still shows (N/A) - FIX THAT
2) if i click draw new and draw an area, it doesn't allow me to hit '+Run new' button at first time. i have to click 'Clear' and re-draw the box again 
to be able to hit 'Run new' button. -FIX THAT. 
3) do not play with the opacity of the visualization layers on the map. clicking them from loaded results tab, will just zoom them but do not fade any of the visualization 
based on the selection. show them at the default opacity and do not fade any of them --FIX THAT. 
4) When i remove the optimizations from the results tab, one visualization gets removed but even though i remove 2 of them, one visualization still stays on the map
and i have to use 'clear all optimizations' to be able to remove the remaining one. if user removes both of them from result tab, then remove everything and do not even show
clear all optimizations, because there is nothing supposed to be left. YOU CAN keep that option when there is 2 optimizations loaded so in case user want to remove all in once -- FIX THAT.
