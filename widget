1) when user draws the optimization first, it doesn't give option to bring a new one by drawing/ recalling. there should be a button above 'clear optimization'
to add new ones by calling or creating. 
2) as i click on loaded results arrow to collapse, it should collapse the items with it, now it's not collapsing at all, we want that section to be collapsible/expandible fully.
3) as user recalls the optimization, it doesn't draw the bounding box around the visualization layer. and it doesn't zoom in when user selects a visualization layer for that 
optimization. 
4) we want to keep all of the visualization layers that user drawn/ or recalled. but switching between them from 'loaded results' should just move the screen to the extent. 
so we want to have bounding box drawn around the recalled optimization bounding box. if it's not possible we should at least zoom there.
